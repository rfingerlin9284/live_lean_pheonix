## Start Here — Three Documents

### 1. [SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md](SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
**Read this first if you are a non-coder.** Plain-English guide explaining what to do step by step, how to give the VS Code agent its instructions, and what to expect while the system runs.

### 2. [VSCODE_AGENT_MEGA_PROMPT.md](VSCODE_AGENT_MEGA_PROMPT.md)
**The master instruction document for the VS Code AI agent.** Contains 24 phases covering every step from installing Python to launching live trading. References exact file paths in exact repos. No placeholder code — everything comes from verified source repos.

### 3. [REPO_SOURCE_MAP.md](REPO_SOURCE_MAP.md)
**Reference map showing which file comes from which repo.** Used by the agent when assembling the system and when individual files need to be refreshed.
