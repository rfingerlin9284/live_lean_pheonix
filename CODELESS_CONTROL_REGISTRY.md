# 🎛️ CODELESS CONTROL REGISTRY

**"I don't want to code. I want to control."**

This document is the central registry for all "Codeless" control mechanisms in the RICK Phoenix V2 system. 
**Agent Mandate:** If the user asks to change a setting or perform an action, check this list first. If a tool exists, tell the user to run it. If not, create the tool, add it here, and THEN tell the user to run it.

## 🤖 Agent Instructions (The "Addendum")

**To the AI Assistant:**

1.  **Never** manually edit `charter.py` or config files unless the user explicitly forbids scripts.
2.  **Always** direct the user to the `Adjust Settings` task for tuning.
3.  **If a requested action has no script:**
    *   **STOP.** Do not just do it.
    *   **CREATE** a script in `scripts/` that performs the action interactively.
    *   **REGISTER** the script in `.vscode/tasks.json`.
    *   **UPDATE** this file (`CODELESS_CONTROL_README.md`).
    *   **TELL** the user: "I've created a new task for that. Run 'Task Name' to do it."
